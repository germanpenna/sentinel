## Problem we solved (2–3 sentences)

Modern teams report dozens of KPIs, but executives still struggle to know if those numbers actually prove their business objectives are being achieved. Metrics are often interpreted in isolation, creating multiple “versions of the truth” and masking real risks. Sentinel provides an objective reality check by cross-validating objectives against KPIs, surfacing contradictions, missing signals, and clear next actions in seconds.

## What Sentinel does (quick summary)

Sentinel lets executives input a business objective and key KPIs, then runs a deterministic “Reality Check” that produces:
- A clear score and risk level
- Key contradictions between narrative and metrics
- Missing signals that should be measured
- Concrete next actions

It includes authentication, billing (Stripe), Pro gating, persistence, and a full end-to-end SaaS experience.
